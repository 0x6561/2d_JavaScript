<div>Here I have implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">Flood Fill Algorithm</a> (both 4-directional and 8-directional) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Cellular Automata (Conway's game of life</a>). The code is GPL and available on <a href="https://github.com/0x6561/2d_JavaScript">GitHub</a> . The Shape fill algorithm is a work in progress. </div>
